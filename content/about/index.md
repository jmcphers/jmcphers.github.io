# About the Site

This site is lovingly handcrafted from organic bytes, and is made possible in part by readers like you, and the following technologies:

- Static site hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- Site generation by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- Some figures generated by [GoAT](https://github.com/blampe/goat)
- CSS includes numerous contributions from [tufte-css](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/), including the *et-book* font


# What's That Weird Logo, Though?

Oh, this?

```goat {.about-logo}
o o o o o
o o * * o
o * * o o
o o * o o
o o o o o
```

It's an [r-pentamino](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/R-pentomino). It is my favorite [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) pattern: from a few humble rules and five humbler cells arises a startling explosion of vigorous complexity. Try it out in the simulator!
