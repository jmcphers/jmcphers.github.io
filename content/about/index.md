# About the Site

This site is lovingly handcrafted from organic bytes, and is made possible in part by the following technologies:

- Static site hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- Site generation by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- Some figures generated by [GoAT](https://github.com/blampe/goat)
- CSS includes numerous contributions from [tufte-css](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/), including the *et-book* font
