There&amp;rsquo;s just something ineffably elegant about having the site pre-built.
There&amp;rsquo;s no code on the web server to break, or patch, or hack. There&amp;rsquo;s no server configuration to screw up. Static sites just Exist, in pristine immutability.
Even better, a static site is usually constructed with plain text files, which means you can use version control systems like Git to manage your content.</description></item></channel></rss>
