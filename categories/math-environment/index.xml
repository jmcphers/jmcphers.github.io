Recently, though, I had a worrisome thought. I&amp;rsquo;m not losing any weight, which means that the calories which power my bike are coming entirely from the food I eat. Now, it&amp;rsquo;s true that it takes less energy to power a bicycle than it does to power a car, but it&amp;rsquo;s also true that producing food energy can be more ecologically harmful than burning gasoline, at least from a carbon footprint standpoint.</description></item></channel></rss>
