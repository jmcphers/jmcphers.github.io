I&rsquo;m not losing any weight, which means that the calories which power my bike are coming entirely from the food I eat. Now, it&rsquo;s true that it takes less energy to power a bicycle than it does to power a car, but it&rsquo;s also true that producing food energy can be more ecologically harmful than burning gasoline, at least from a carbon footprint standpoint. Was I really reducing my carbon footprint by bicycling?</p><p>The answer is, as it so often turns out to be, &ldquo;maybe&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s start with a worst-case scenario, in which all of the extra food I eat in order to power my bicycle comes from hamburgers.</p><ul><li>Producing 1kg of beef is like <a href=http://www.greeneatz.com/foods-carbon-footprint.html>driving 63 miles in a car</a>.</li><li>1kg of beef has <a href="https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list?qlookup=23568">about 2,500 calories</a>.</li></ul><p>Given my weight and average speed, I&rsquo;m burning somewhere around 50 calories per mile on the bike. That means that the 2,500 calories of beef will last me 50 miles.</p><p>In other words, my hamburger-fueled bicycle actually has a <em>worse</em> carbon footprint than driving alone in a car!</p><p>The good news is that, given the actual composition of my diet (which is considerably less than 100% hamburgers), I come out ahead on the carbon footprint &ndash; but it&rsquo;s not the tremendous boon I first imagined it to be. If you&rsquo;re looking to cut your carbon footprint, <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/sunday-review/the-biggest-carbon-sin-air-travel.html>air travel</a> might be a better first target.</p><p class=footer>copyright &copy; 2022 Jonathan McPherson</p></div></body></html>
