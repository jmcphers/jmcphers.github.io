<p>Our family stayed at a hotel that offered free AT&T WiFi with an access code
was distributed at the lobby.</p><p>&ldquo;Just connect to the network <code>attwifi</code> and enter the code,&rdquo; the brochure said.</p><p>The network had a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_portal>captive portal</a>,
a page you had to open to enter your code before your device would be allowed
to use the Internet.</p><p>Ordinarily, my Android phone (running Lollipop) detects this and shows a
notification asking me to sign into the network. This time, though, it wasn&rsquo;t
working. On most captive portals, attempting to load <em>any</em> URL causes a
redirect to the captive portal, but on this particular network, the HTTP
requests were just failing.</p><p>After a bit of searching I unearthed two helpful bits of information:</p><ul><li><p>People mentioned that their Apple devices &ldquo;just work&rdquo; when connecting, but
have had problems with Android.</p></li><li><p>Apple devices <a href=http://blog.erratasec.com/2010/09/apples-secret-wispr-request.html>attempt to load a well-known URL</a>
on Apple&rsquo;s web site to detect a captive portal:
<a href=http://www.apple.com/library/test/success.html>http://www.apple.com/library/test/success.html</a>.</p></li></ul><p>The solution? I brought up Chrome on the Android phone and manually entered the
Apple URL. This time the portal detected the request, redirected me to the
log-in page, and all went swimmingly.</p><p>So, the moral of the story: if your Android device won&rsquo;t detect captive
portals, it may be that the problem is that the captive portal isn&rsquo;t
redirecting all URL requests&ndash;only those that seem to be sniffing for a portal.
Try Apple&rsquo;s URL.</p>
